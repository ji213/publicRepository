---Notes for C/C++ coding


What to install to run on mac:
	Visual Studio Code
	XCode
	CodeLite

C++
	supports the principles of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Difference between C and C++
	Similar syntax
	C++ supports polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance because it is an OOP, C is not an OOP

#include
	preprocessor directive
	tells the compiler to include the contents of a file in the source code
	#include<iostream> 
		tells the compiler to include the standard iostream file which contains declarations of all the standard input/output library functions

using namespace std
	used to import the entity of the std namespace into the current namespace of the program
	generally considered bad practice

	The std namespace is huge. The alternative to this statement is to specify the namespace to which the identifier belongs using the scope operator(::) each time we declare a type. For example, std::cout

int main(){}
	A function is a group of statements that are designed to perform a specific task. The main() function is the entry point of every C++ program, no matter where the function is located in the program.

	The opening braces ‘{‘ indicates the beginning of the main function and the closing braces ‘}’ indicates the ending of the main function

typedef
	reserved keyword used to create an additional name (alias) for another data type
	example:
		typedef int number_t;

		now I can initialize a variable by doing:
			number_t testVariable = 10;

	using text_t = std::string; (similar to typedef, more common)


Arithmetic operators
	example
		x = x + 1;
			adds 1 to x
		x+=1;
			same thing
getline function


Type conversion
	implicit - automatic
		int x = 3.14;
	explicit - precede value with new data type
		double x = (int)100;
		cout << (char) 100

#include <cmath>


switch(x)
	example:
		int x; // user input int 1-10;

		switch(x){
			case 1:
				std::cout << "User input 1";
			case 2:
				std::cout << "User input 2";
			etc...
			default:
				std::cout << "Enter in 1-10 only"
		}

ternary operator ?: 
	replacement to an if/else statement
	condition ? expression1 : expression 2
	example
		int grade = 50;
		grade >= 60 ? std::cout << "Pass" : std::cout << "Fail";

logical operators
	&& = check if two conditions are true
	|| = 'or'... check if at least one of the two conditions are true
	!  = 'not' reverses the logical state of its operand

do while loop
	do some block of code first, then repeat again if condition is true. 

for loop
	for(int index = 1; i<=3; i++){}

srand
	https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/srand/

overloaded Functions
	

local variables
	declared inside a function or block

global variables 
	access in entire file
	best to avoid if you can cause it pollutes global namespace

--TODO: Start looking into data structures and algorithms in C++, and adding projects to the repository
